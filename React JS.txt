What is ReactJS ?
->React is a component-based library that helps you build UI by breaking it into reusable pieces called Component.

Library :-
---- GSAP
---- Lenis
---- ReactJS

Real DOM(Document Object Model) :-
->The actual structure  of your webpage that the browser creates from HTML.

Virtual DOM :-
-> This is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM used mainly by React
-> It is created and stored in memort, not on the actual webpage.

create vite(folder in react)

->> npm create vite
->> react
->> javascript
->> cd app-name
->>npm install
->>npm run dev

React Files Are executed : -
1). index.html
2). main.jsx
3). App.jsx

library flow that can you handle but Framework has own flow  

Component :- A component is the building block of a React application.
Components let you split the UI into reusable, independent pieces.

What is JSX?

Function call :- A function call in React JS means exrcuting a javaScript function inside a React Component.

State :- 
-> State is a container to store data like variable.
-> This is mutable and dynamic.
-> We have to import it when we want to use it.
-> It re-render component automatically so that data can visible on UI.

Hooks in React JS :-
-> Hooks are the special features for functional component
-> Hooks let you use different React featues from your component
	-> State,
	-> Life cycle method
	-> Side effects 
1). useState :- If you want something to update on the screen (UI), you need useState.

Toggle or Hide and Show in React :-
-> Toggle -> Switch a value between true / false
-> Hide / Show -> Use a boolean state to conditionally render content

Props :- Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Controlled Component:- A controlled component in React if form input(like input, textarea, or select) whose value is controlled by React state, not by the DOM.

-> Validation and Manipulation Before Submit
-> Dynamic Updates Values
