What is ReactJS ?
->React is a component-based library that helps you build UI by breaking it into reusable pieces called Component.

return ( <> </> ) : - This is the JSX returned by the component.

<> </> is called a React Fragment.

vite :- it is the modern frontend build tool used to create fast React, Vue and JavaScript application

Library :-
---- GSAP
---- Lenis
---- ReactJS

Real DOM(Document Object Model) :-
->The actual structure  of your webpage that the browser creates from HTML.

Virtual DOM :-
-> This is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM used mainly by React
-> It is created and stored in memort, not on the actual webpage.

create vite(folder in react)

->> npm create vite
->> react
->> javascript
->> cd app-name
->>npm install
->>npm run dev

React Files Are executed : -
1). index.html
2). main.jsx
3). App.jsx

difference between library and Framework
library flow that can you handle but Framework has own flow  

Component :- A component is the building block of a React application.
Components let you split the UI into reusable, independent pieces.

What is JSX?
->>JSX is a syntax extension for Javascript that lets you write HTML like markup inside a Javascript file.

Click Event :- Events in React JS are actions or interaction that happen in the browser, such as clicking, typing, submitting a form , hovering.

Function call :- A function call in React JS means exrcuting a javaScript function inside a React Component.

State :- 
-> State is a container to store data like variable.
-> This is mutable and dynamic.
-> We have to import it when we want to use it.
-> It re-render component automatically so that data can visible on UI.

Hooks in React JS :-
-> Hooks are the special features for functional component
-> Hooks let you use different React featues from your component
	-> State,
	-> Life cycle method
	-> Side effects 
1). useState :- If you want something to update on the screen (UI), you need useState.

Toggle or Hide and Show in React :-
-> Toggle -> Switch a value between true / false
-> Hide / Show -> Use a boolean state to conditionally render content

Props :- Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Controlled Component:- A controlled component in React if form input(like input, textarea, or select) whose value is controlled by React state, not by the DOM.

benefits of Controlled Component:-
-> Single Source of Truth
-> Validation and Manipulation Before Submit
-> Dynamic Updates Values

Handle Checkbox :- The checkBox value is controlled by React state not by the browser.

What is Array ?
=> Array is a collection of similar data type.

What are hooks?
=> Hooks in React are special function that allow functional components to use React features like state, lifecycle method, and context without writing class component

Popular React Hooks :-
-> useState
-> useEffect
-> useContext
-> useRef
-> useReducer

What is useEffect Hook?
-> useEffect is a React Hook used to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, timers, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM

Use of useEffect Hook :-
The useEffect hook is used to handle side effects in React functional components, such as API calls, timers, event listeners, subscriptions, and DOM updates, after the component renders.

Basic use of useEffect:-
-> Prevent Extra rendering of component on state

syntax :-

useEffect(pass function as parameter, dependency )

useEffect(() => {
// write your Code
},[State or props])

Component LifeCycle :-
React Life Cycle Methods :- 

Mounting ->                                Updating ->                                       Unmounting
                                                           |
                                                           |
                                                           |
                                                 Error Handling

Mounting :- This phase involve the creation and insertion of the component into the DOM.

Updating : - Occurs when the component re-renders due to state or prop changes.

Unmounting :- The component is removed from the DOM.

React Using CSS :-
-> Inline Styele :- Use the style attribute directly on your elements.
-> Bit different from basic css.

<div style = {{  color : "blue",  fontSize: "10px"  }}>Hello World!</div>

External CSS :- Make separate file for css
And inport to components

.container {
background-color: red;
padding: 20px;
}

CSS Modules :-
-> Similar to external CSS files,
-> But ensures that styles are locally scoped to a specific component

.container {
background-color: blue;
padding : 20px
}

External CSS :-
- Make separate file for css
- And import to components

// style.css
.container {
background-color : blue;
padding : 20px
}

Styled Components :-
- In React, styled-components is a library that allows you to write CSS directly within your JavaScript components.
- This approch is known as CSS-in-js

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 16px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;

Utility-first Libraries :-
-> Material-UI
-> React Bootstrap
-> Tailwind CSS 

Dynamic and Conditional inline Style : -
=>

Styled Component :- Styled Component is a CSS library used in React to write CSS inside JS and style components in a component scoped way
